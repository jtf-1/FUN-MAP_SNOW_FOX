Operation Snowfox is a persistent, open world PvE playground for the Persian Gulf map. The mission will randomly choose targets throughout the map. You can fly any role you like, and if you are on your own, you can use the radio menu to request support flights of AI planes to assist you. Most modules have been included. You will be flying against Iranian forces, who are supported by the Russians.

Requesting support flights:
--------------------------

- CAP/CAS/Anti-Shipping/SEAD and Pinpoint Strikes are available to call in, you can choose the sector they will fly to
- Only one flight of each type can be active at any given time, so choose carefully
- AI flights will start near Khasab airfield and will await a "Push" command via radio when you are ready for them to proceed with an attack
- Pinpoint Strikes will only attack a mission target if the target is within the sector they are called to

Other radio options:
--------------------

- Check Current Objective will remind you what the current target is
- Target Report will give you coordinates and distance to the target, and if the target is a group it will tell you how many units are remaining in the group
- Abort Directives will allow you to send support flights back to base
- Skip Mission under Snowfox Options will allow you to put the current mission back into the pool and draw another one
- Snowfox CAP options will allow you to enable the Khasab Viper squadron, and separately, a choice between Fleet Defence Tomcats or Hornets
- Snowfox Sound Options will allow you to toggle sound events for weapon firing on or off
